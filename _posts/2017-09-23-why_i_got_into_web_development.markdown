Prior to starting with Flatiron, coding seemed so far out of the realm of possibilty for me. 

In college, I was studying marketing and public relations - seemingly as far you can get from the technicality required in web development. Aside from a little bit of HTML, CSS, and Python on Codecademy.com, my exposure to computer programming and web dev. came from co-workers at my on-campus job that I held throughout college.

Sharing an office with the campus Help Desk, I shared desks with budding cyber security and software engineering students. Their projects and tests couldn't have been any different than mine, and I would pick their brians from time to time, amazed by each story.

While my marketing and PR classes consisted of creating brands & products, I realized that the creation element that drew me to brand development also existed in coding.

And yes, it also paid more.

Once I started getting into Ruby, I got a sense of just how many doors coding can open. Even without working in a development role, the roles I was looking to take out of school could implement coding in some way, shape, or form.

I remember thinking to myself that (ideally) I would have a desk job out of school, and that any job I was trying to land would consist of me being on a computer all day.

Seeing the capabilities that my co-workers had, I felt that working at a computer without development knowledge meant limiting your abilities and potential in a bad way.

With that in mind, I started the online version of the Flatiron School while working as a digital marketing - and although I'm far from being done, I've already felt the benefits come into play. I can be more independent with my workflow; working on webpages now means hitting less (or slightly less) roadblocks than before - and it's a very rewarding feeling.

With that, I'm looking forward to working through more languages and completing this course.
