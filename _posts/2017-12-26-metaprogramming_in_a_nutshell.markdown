Metaprogramming enables programs to read and analyze themselves in order to modify data. In other words, it allows code to act introspectively, running callbacks within a program - ultimately leading to cleaner code.

The 'headline' for this technique should be: "Programs can treat themselves as data." Essentially, it's a program within a program - hence 'metaprogramming'.

Benefits to metaprogramming include cleaner code (remember: 'DRY') as well as configuring data analysis from runtime to compile-time. Not only is it easier to read, but it's faster!

Perhaps the most impressive aspect of metaprogramming is that the process is often used so that programs can write code themselves! 

Given the mantra of programmers being 'lazy', a nod to the impact of programming and the efficiency of programs, code that writes itself is a dream come true. 

Elements of programming such as classes and object inheritance are the driving forces behind metaprogramming.

By cutting down the lenght of code, metaprogramming saves time when writing, debugging, and running programs, making it a great tool for object oriented programming.
